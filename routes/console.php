 | SiteArchive scheduled tasks
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | The scheduler ticks once a minute and dispatches CrawlSiteJob for any
 | site whose next_run_at has passed. `withoutOverlapping` prevents the
 | tick from stacking up if a previous dispatch is still running.
 |
 | Run the scheduler locally with:
 |     php artisan schedule:work
 |
 | In production, add a cron entry per the Laravel docs:
 |     * * * * * cd /path/to/site-archive && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

Schedule::command('crawl:dispatch-due')
    ->everyMinute()

// Intentionally NOT ->runInBackground() — that spawns a visible cmd.exe
// window on Windows every minute. Our command finishes in a few hundred
// milliseconds (it just queries due sites and popen-spawns detached
// crawl processes), so running it inline in the scheduler's own php-win
// process is plenty fast and completely silent.

 | Storage retention — nightly soft-delete of crawls past their cutoff
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | Per-site retention setting (default 3 months) decides what's "too old".
 | Soft-deleted crawls go to the trash, recoverable for the trash retention
 | window (default 7 days). The trash purge then hard-deletes them and
 | frees disk space via the dedup pool's reference counting.
 |
 | Default time is 03:00 — admin can change via Settings.cleanup_hour.
 | Reads the hour at scheduler-tick time so changes take effect on the
 | NEXT day's run without redeploying.
