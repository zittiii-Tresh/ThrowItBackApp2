# SiteArchive — session handoff

Internal web-archive tool for Sites at Scale. Wayback-Machine-style captures
of managed sites on a schedule, with a Filament admin + Livewire user UI.

Started from a blank machine; this file captures where the previous session
left off so a fresh Claude pick-up has full context.

## Stack (decided up-front, do not change without reason)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Laravel 11.51** | not 12 or 13 — Filament 3 requires 10/11 |
| Admin UI | **Filament 3** | auto-installed Livewire 3 as a peer dep |
| User UI | **Livewire 3** full-page components | 4 components in `app/Livewire/` |
| CSS | **Tailwind 3** (not 4) | brand palette in `tailwind.config.js` |
| DB | **MySQL 8.4** (Laragon) | `site_archive` database |
| Cache / sessions | **Redis 5** | installed as a Windows service |
| Crawl engine | **spatie/crawler 8** + Guzzle | see CrawlSiteJob |
| Diff | **sebastian/diff** | Compare screen |
| OS | **Windows 10/11 + Laragon** | prod would be Linux — all code is cross-platform |

### Windows-specific gotchas (already handled, don't re-solve)

- **No `ext-pcntl`** — `composer require --ignore-platform-req=ext-pcntl` is
  how every install ran. Horizon is installed but not used on dev.
- **No phpredis extension** — using `predis/predis` (pure PHP Redis client).
- **SSL CA bundle** — `curl.cainfo` + `openssl.cafile` in `php.ini` point at
  `C:/laragon/etc/ssl/cacert.pem`. Without this, Guzzle fails all HTTPS.
- **Queue workers don't run reliably on Windows** (no pcntl). We deliberately
  avoid `queue:work` for scheduled crawls — see "Zero-maintenance" below.

## What's built — 20 commits on `main`

Phases roughly track the proposal PDF's 7 admin + 5 user screens.

| Phase | Commit | What |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffold | `cb4f6c8` | Laravel 11 + Filament 3 + Horizon install, admin user, `.env` for MySQL/Redis |
| Landing polish | `ba48a3d` | gradient + drifting purple blobs on `/` |
| 2 — Sites | `85c5eb9` | `sites` table, `Site` model, `SiteResource` Filament CRUD, frequency enums, `Schedule::nextRunFor` |
| 3 — Crawl engine | `bef603d` | `crawl_runs`/`snapshots`/`assets` tables, `CrawlSiteJob`, `ArchiveCrawlObserver`, `AssetDownloader`, `HtmlRewriter`, `SnapshotStorage` |
| 3.5 — Playback preview | `644d405` | `ArchiveController`, inline `style="background-image"` rewrite, CSS `url()` rewrite |
| 4 — Scheduler wiring | `166afd9` | `DispatchDueCrawlsCommand`, `routes/console.php` schedule |
| 5 — Admin screens | `4aba50f` | Dashboard widgets, CrawlRun resource, `system_events`/`settings` tables, Notifications + Settings pages |
| Cleanup | `54fefdc`, `7e98226` | removed demo/seed data — only real sites |
| Admins | `da8d0e7` + `d14de95` + `319bffa` | `/admin/users` CRUD, email verification flow, surfaced Delete |
| 6 — User archive | `43e8ec3`, `b315631`, `7bda748` | ArchiveHome, ArchiveBrowse (calendar), ArchiveViewer (iframe + toolbar + assets), ArchiveCompare |
| 6f — Crawl fixes | `ca26a60` | concurrency=3, delay 200ms, font mime fallback |
| 7 — Polish | `498a6b6` | live progress bar, consistent View actions, notification hover glow, dark mode contrast |
| Detached fix | `45d0ce8` | `popen('start /B ...')` so crawls actually run after Filament request returns |
| Zero-maintenance | `b6f1759` | `DispatchDueCrawlsCommand` spawns detached too; Windows Task Scheduler; Redis as service |
| Notifications scope | `c9febb4` | filter to `event='crawl.failed'`; drop `runInBackground()` from schedule (silences cmd flash) |

## Current runtime state

### Services (should all be up when dev machine is on)

```
MySQL    — via Laragon (user must tick "Auto start" in Laragon preferences)
Redis    — Windows service, StartType=Automatic, runs as SYSTEM
Laravel  — `php artisan serve` (the user starts this manually per dev session)
```

Check with:
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root
redis-cli ping
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Windows Scheduled Task — "SiteArchive Scheduler"

```
Execute:    C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.3.30-Win32-vs16-x64\php-win.exe
Arguments:  artisan schedule:run
Cwd:        C:\Users\sitesatscale\Documents\SAS SiteArchive\site-archive
Trigger:    every 1 minute, repeats 3650 days
Principal:  current user, **S4U** logon, Limited privileges
```

S4U (Service-for-User) is critical: with `InteractiveToken` Windows attaches a
conhost.exe to the spawned php-win.exe and a black console flashes every minute
even though php-win itself is windowless. S4U runs the task in the user's
account context without an interactive desktop session, so no console is ever
attached. Modifying the principal requires an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
schtasks /Create /TN "SiteArchive Scheduler" /XML <task.xml> /F
```

The original registration is in commit `b6f1759` (was Interactive); the silent-flash fix is in this session's work.

### Real sites in DB

| id | name | URL | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | Honeycomb Agency | https://www.honeycombagency.com.au | never crawled |
| 7 | TEST | https://tmdbportfolio.netlify.app | multiple successful runs, primary test target |
| 8 | TEST 2 | https://gpagalingportfolio.netlify.app | tiny SPA, useful for fast-feedback tests |

### Performance knobs (config/archive.php → .env overrides)

```
ARCHIVE_CRAWL_CONCURRENCY=10        # parallel HTTP per crawl (drop to 3-5 if a host rate-limits)
ARCHIVE_CRAWL_DELAY_MS=0            # ms between requests; bump only if a target needs throttling
ARCHIVE_CRAWL_TIMEOUT=30            # per-request timeout
ARCHIVE_CRAWL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10
ARCHIVE_CRAWL_MAX_REDIRECTS=3
ARCHIVE_ASSET_MAX_AGE=31536000      # 1y; assets are content-addressed by sha1 so cache is safe
```

## Architectural decisions worth remembering

### 1. "Crawl now" and scheduled crawls both use detached `popen` spawn

Rather than dispatch jobs to the Redis queue and require a `queue:work` worker
to process them (which is fragile on Windows), both flows spawn
`php artisan crawl:run {id} --run-id={runId}` as a detached process:

- Parent (Filament request OR scheduler tick) creates a `CrawlRun` row
  in status=Running synchronously, so the UI sees "Crawling" on its next
  2-second poll.
- `popen('start /B "" php-win artisan crawl:run ...')` detaches the child
  on Windows. `start /B` is the key — Symfony Process's `->start()` does
  NOT detach cleanly on Windows.
- Child process survives the parent's exit and updates the existing
  `CrawlRun` row as pages complete.

### 2. Html rewriting happens at crawl time for assets, view time for anchors

- **Asset refs** (`<img>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, inline `style` bg-images, CSS
  `url()`) are rewritten at crawl time to `/archive/asset/{snapshot_id}/{sha1}`
  — because we need them to point at archived copies, not the live (possibly
  deleted) originals.
- **`<a href>` anchor links** are rewritten at VIEW time in
  `ArchiveController::rewriteAnchors()` — because at crawl time the sibling
  snapshots may not exist yet (we're still crawling them).
- Outbound anchor links are neutralized to `href="#"` with the original URL
  kept in `data-archived-href="..."` — prevents accidentally leaving the archive.

### 3. Failed captures still get a snapshot row

When a page fetch returns 0/4xx/5xx, `ArchiveCrawlObserver::crawlFailed`
still creates a snapshot row (with empty `html_path`) so the Crawl History
can show what was attempted. The viewer renders a "Capture failed" empty
state for these instead of 404-ing — keeps the "every row has View" UX
the user asked for.

### 4. Only crawl failures show in Notifications

`Notifications::failureQuery()` scopes to `event='crawl.failed'`. Successful
crawls, partial crawls, storage warnings, "site added" events are all still
logged to `system_events` (potential future activity log) but kept out of
the feed. User-requested.

### 5. Silent crawl spawns on Windows — three layers

Stacked because any one of them alone leaks a console window:

1. **Task Scheduler uses S4U logon** (not InteractiveToken) — otherwise
   Windows attaches conhost.exe to the spawned php-win.exe per tick.
2. **php-win.exe** (windowless PHP subsystem) for both schedule:run and
   the detached `crawl:run` children. `app/Support/DetachedCrawl.php`
   forces `php-win.exe` even when PHP_BINARY is `php.exe` (e.g. the
   Filament "Crawl now" path running under `artisan serve`).
3. **proc_open with `bypass_shell => true`** for the detach — `popen()`
   on Windows always wraps in `cmd.exe /c …`, and that cmd needs a
   console. `proc_open` with `bypass_shell` calls CreateProcess directly
   on php-win, no shell, no console. proc_close is intentionally NOT
   called — it would block waiting for the child to exit.

---

## Known issues / deferred

- **GitHub push**: `sitesatscale/site-archive` returned "Repository not found"
  at the start. Still not pushed — user needs to confirm repo exists or
  create it empty. All 20 commits are local on `main`.
- **SPA pages intermittently status=0**: Netlify cold starts + rate limits
  sometimes make crawls return zero status. Already mitigated with
  concurrency=3, 200ms delay, 30s timeout. True fix would be Browsershot
  (headless Chrome) — deferred to when a site really needs it.
- **True 24/7 automation**: Windows Task Scheduler only fires when the PC is
  on. For run-even-when-PC-is-off, deploy to a Linux VPS — Laravel Forge +
  DigitalOcean ~$17/mo, or free tiers on Fly.io/Railway. Deferred.
- **Assets "other" bucket**: a handful of assets (JSON manifests, misc)
  still fall into `other`. AssetType classifier handles the common cases
  (images, CSS, JS, fonts) — extending it when new types show up is easy.

## Where to resume from

1. **User wants to push to GitHub** → ask for the correct repo URL, then
   `git remote add origin …` + `git push -u origin main`. Confirm before
   push per the original plan.
2. **User wants a new feature** → follow the existing phase pattern, commit
   per phase with detailed commit messages, don't introduce a new model
   without checking the existing schema.
3. **User reports a bug** → check `storage/logs/laravel.log` first, then
   tail the Windows Scheduled Task history if it's scheduler-related.

Commit messages follow a `type(scope): subject` prefix (see `git log`) with
a detailed body. Every commit includes `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`. Stick to
the pattern.
